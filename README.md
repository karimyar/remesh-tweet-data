# remesh-tweet-data
Remesh Data Visualization project for Ali Karimyar

This project is based off Python3 and can be run through the terminal (or command line prompt). Make sure the json file (i.e. Twitter data) is in the directory as the actualy python file. 

The Python file utilizes certain libraries such as json, pandas, plotly, and dash, so please be sure to install those (see below for commands to install each).

To run the program, open the terminal (or command line prompt) and navigate to the folder where the json data file and python project file are hosted. I put these files on the desktop so it's easier to navigate to. Make sure to install the various required Python libraries within this folder (see below). Once you're navigated in the folder in the terminal, type "python3 project.py" in command line and the program should execute. 

If it is succesfull you will see a prompt pop up underneath the previous command saying: "Dash is running on http://a-url", this URL is a localhot where the actual Python-based interactive data visuailzation is occuring. I am using the Dash library, which allows for creating reactive/interactive web-based visualziation and applications.  

Installation commands:

pip install json 

pip install pandas

pip install plotly

pip install dash
